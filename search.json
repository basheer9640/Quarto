    "text": "November, is not conducive to high altitudes (camping at or above ~ 4000 m/13000 ft) in the Western Himalayas. It is mainly due to the chances of snowfall, cold conditions, or a scarcity of water. Additionally, permits for these treks are getting more difficult to get during this time.\nHowever, your time to visit the Himalayas is perfect to get clear autumn weather; climate change is very clear in the Himalayas. As a result, things are more complicated at higher altitudes.\nWe had a friend recommend you all due to your flexibility in creating tours and tailored recommendations. We are interested in an itinerary that has both a homestay and a camping style. Also curious if it might be possible to do a combination?\nTaking into account your experience and expectations, we may propose an interesting hiking option to you. That trail is on the far eastern side of Garhwal, bordering the Kumaon region. We can focus on the Ali Bedni Bugyal trek while extending it from the Bagji Bugyal side. Then possibly making a summit attempt to Roopkund (~ 4800 m) as well. Camping above Ali Bugyal is banned (that is, the trek is closed at present), but attempting Roopkund and returning in a day is not restricted. The entire trail offers magnificent high mountain views as well as splendid alpine meadows, locally called “Bugyal”. You get panoramic views as well as fairly closeups of the high peaks. In between, you will get the opportunity to stay in really interior Himaayan villages and eat as the locals do. We will combine both camping and homestays to do the same.\nMoreover, there will be hardly any other hikers on the below trail, apart from a few in the Ali Bedni stretch, if at all there are any! You can enjoy nature at its best while hiking with your local guide.\nA probable circuit is: Ghes village – Bagji Bugyal – Himni village – Balan village – Ali – Bedni Bugyal – Roopkund attempt and back – to Ali Bugyal – Didna village – Wan village – Brahmatal – Lohajung.\nWith your experience and ability to move fast, it is possible to complete the above trail in 7 hiking days. Add a couple of days for the to-and-from basecamp journey. So it is 9 days from Rishikesh to Rishikesh.\nThank you so much for the information. This is great! A map would certainly be helpful as we try to wrap our brains around what these options may look like. One question regarding summiting Roopkund – would that require alpine kits? For example, while we are planning to bring warm weather gear, we will not have micro-spikes or crampons. That sounds like an amazing opportunity, but I want to make sure it is feasible based on the limitations of our packing list. I will look into this more and try to get a sense of what is possible. We are certainly interested in a large trek, however, are limited in the amount we can pack. We will be traveling for over a month in India with limited space as I am sure you can understand. You will only be required to carry your warm clothing (3 layers of clothing, including a waterproof), a backpacking boot, and some trail mix, clif/protein bars in your backpack. That’s it! We will provide you with a tent when required, along with other camping logistics as required. You may bring your sleeping bags for hygiene, or we may provide them from our stock as well (although ours don’t pack small!) This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts."
